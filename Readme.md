Battleship (javabased)

This is my test driven dev of the game Battleship as a java application. There are two players and 10 ships for everybody to place and destroy.

I use JUnit5.4 and opdenjsk-14 for the project with the IntelliJ IDE on a linux system

At the end, there will be a console ui, and a tcp-support to play via the internet. Hopefully :)
